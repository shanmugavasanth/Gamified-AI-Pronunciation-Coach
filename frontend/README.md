# Gamified AI Pronunciation Coach
A web-based interactive platform that helps users improve their English pronunciation using Whisper AI and gamified learning techniques.
The system evaluates spoken input, provides real-time feedback, and enhances user engagement through scoring, XP rewards, and leveling.

## About

The Gamified AI Pronunciation Coach is designed to support English learners by integrating AI-driven speech recognition, audio analysis, and gamification mechanics.
Traditional pronunciation practice often lacks real-time feedback and motivation. This project solves these limitations by enabling users to:

Record speech directly from the browser

Receive instant transcription and pronunciation accuracy

Identify mispronounced words

Progress through levels using a scoring and XP system

The system uses Whisper AI for robust speech-to-text processing and a Flask backend for API handling, combined with a simple browser-based frontend for accessibility.

## Features

- Utilizes Whisper AI for accurate speech transcription.

- Real-time pronunciation scoring and feedback.

- Gamified user experience with XP, levels, and score progression.

- Lightweight Flask-based backend for API handling.

- Browser-based audio recording using JavaScript.

- Modular and scalable structure.

- Easy to deploy and extend for academic or personal use.
